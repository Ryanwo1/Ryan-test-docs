Microsoft Excel has become one of the most widely used software in all the industries. And data analysis is one of the most important functionalities in Excel which includes sorting, conditional formatting, charts and so on.

## Sorting

### Sort Sheet or sort range

Sort sheet means when we sort a category of values according to a specific pattern, all other correlated values will be moved because of it. Let’s read the example below.


In the original worksheet, all the information was sorted by the “Homeroom” column. However, if we sort the whole sheet again alphabetically by the “Last Name” of people, then not only the order of “Last Name” did change, but information in other columns which is related to this name also moves. 
Sort range means we only sort a part of the cells in a sheet, and it will be convenient when there are a few different tables in the same worksheet. Let’s read another example below. 


There are more than 1 table in the sheet, so we only want to sort the “Total Orders (by Grade)” on the right. Then after sorting range alphabetically by “Class”, all the cells of “Payment Method” on the left will never be affected.
